            <div class="pra">
                <p>UI refers to the screens, buttons, toggles, icons, and other visual elements that you interact with when using a website, app, or other electronic device. UX refers to the entire interaction you have with the product, including how you feel about the interaction. While UI certainly have an impact on UX, the two are distinct, as are the roles that designers play. <br> <br> Developing a product that people love often requires both good UI and good UX . For example, you could have a banking app that looks great and has intuitive navigation (UI). But if the app loads slowly or makes you click through numerous screens to transfer money (UX), it doesn't matter how good it looks. <br> <br> On the other hand, a website could be loaded with unique, helpful content organized in a logical and intuitive way. But if it looks dated or you can't easily firgure out how to move between screens or scroll through options, you're likely to click away from the site.</p>
